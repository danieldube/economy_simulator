Implement ONLY Phase 6 using strict test-driven development, according to AGENTS.md and PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md. 
Start by creating or updating tests for Phase 6. Then implement the necessary code, keeping all other phases untouched except for minimal stubs. 
Ensure the full pytest suite passes. When finished, update NEXT_COMMAND.md to Phase 7.
