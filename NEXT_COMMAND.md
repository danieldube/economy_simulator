You are connected to a repo that contains AGENTS.md and PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md.

1. Read both files carefully.
2. Implement ONLY Phase 2 of the implementation plan described in PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md, using strict test-driven development:
   - First add or update tests that specify the expected behaviour for Phase 2.
   - Then implement or extend the code so that these tests pass.
   - Refactor where useful while keeping all tests green.
3. Do NOT implement functionality from later phases, except for minimal stubs needed to make tests compile.
4. Run `pytest` and ensure the full test suite passes when you are done with Phase 2.
